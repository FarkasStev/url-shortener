This java project is an opportunity for me to practice using the Spring Framework


## Current state

Currently working on implementing this using plain spring (no boot) and having it run on a tomcat server, persisting the data to a postgres database

## Future state

Once this is in a workable place, would like to create an alternate branch and reimplement with spring boot, to familiarize the things that doing this will simplify and abstract away
